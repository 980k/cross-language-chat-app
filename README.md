## Methodology
### Framework
- **ASP.NET**
    - ASP.NET defined the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for the entirety of the application.
    - Chat room, user, and message models were defined as data models for how they would stored in the database.
    - Views were the UI components and would be served via server-side rendering.
    - Controllers handled user input, such as sending messages, by passing data through forms and processing them through the RESTful API.

### Frontend
- **HTML**
    - HTML and CSS form the foundation for the user interface and visual components.
    - The login page, landing page, and various forms were developed using HTML.
    - CSS was used to style these components, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.

- **JavaScript**
    - JavaScript played a crucial role in client-side interactions.
    - Key functionalities included:
        - Creating chat rooms dynamically.
        - Navigating between existing chat rooms.
        - Adding users to chat rooms.

### Backend
- **C#**
    - C# was the language of choice for creating a RESTful API.
    - Server-side actions and rendering were handled using C#.
    - CRUD operations related to chat rooms, user management, and message handling were implemented.
    - Dependency injection facilitated loose coupling with the database.

- **PostgreSQL**
    - PostgreSQL served as the database.
    - It stored information such as user profiles, chat room details, and messages.
    - The relational nature of PostgreSQL ensured seamless connections between users and the chat rooms they participated in.

### External API
- **DeepL Translate API**
    - DeepL Translate API handled message translations.
    - Integrated the API into a translation method that took a message as a string and returned the translated message as output.
